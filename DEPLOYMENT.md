# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to github.com and click "New repository"
   - Name it something like `travel-solution-website`
   - Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Upload files**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop all files from this folder
   - Commit the files

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Access your website**
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/travel-solution-website`
   - It may take a few minutes to deploy

### Option 2: Using Git Commands

```bash
# Create and navigate to a new directory
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travel-solution-website.git
cd travel-solution-website

# Copy all website files to this directory
# Then add, commit, and push

git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Travel Solution website"
git push origin main
```

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the root directory containing your domain name
2. Configure your domain's DNS to point to GitHub Pages
3. Enable custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
